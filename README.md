# Lilygo-T-Display-1.19-AMOLED-Minimal


Minimal PlatformIO project for Lilygo T-display S3 1.19 inch OLED with touch.  Project includes LVGL V8.3.11.

Basic version demos screen in Portrait, with simple button, slider, touch coodinates and Home button functionality

Squareline Project Basic Example included with the above functionality, however all but the slider value implemented external to Squareline.

Eez Studio Example has the button implemented with external function but other external components (home button and x:y touch feedback) not working for reason unknown (presumably the way Eez Studio implements object?).

Decided on Squareline Studio for implementation however has a limit to screens and widgets.
